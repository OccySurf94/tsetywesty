# ABOUT ME
Hello there! I'm Occy and I love to make games. I am currently looking into C++ and how it can be used for Game Development (learning awesome stuff on the way!). I would love to work in the Game Industry some day and hope to make fun and enjoyable games for everyone to play :D. Thank you for taking a look at this and I hope you have a nice day, Cya!
